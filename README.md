# Visual Explanations for CNN
Experiments with GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM.

Analyzing and benchmarking the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models using the NIH X-Ray databases, while also evaluating their attention mechanisms via GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM techniques.

The CNN models under scrutiny include:

- DenseNet121 and DenseNet169
- ResNet50, ResNet50V2, ResNet101, ResNet101V2, ResNet152, ResNet152V2
- VGG16

By training and comparing these models on the NIH X-Ray databases, we aim to discern their efficacy in medical image analysis tasks. Additionally, we'll employ GradCAM, GradCAM++, and ScoreCAM methods to inspect the regions of interest identified by the networks, providing insights into their interpretability and diagnostic capabilities.
